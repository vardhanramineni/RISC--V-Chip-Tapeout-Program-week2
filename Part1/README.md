##BabySoC 
- Open-source System on Chip (SoC) based on RVMYTH, a RISC-V-based processor core.
-  The SoC integrates a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) for precise clock generation and control, alongside a 10-bit Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) for interfacing with external analog systems. 


## 1. Understanding System on a Chip (SoC)

   A **System on a Chip (SoC)** is like a mini-computer built on a single chip. Instead of needing separate parts for each function, an SoC combines everything into one small package. This makes it especially useful for devices where space, power, and efficiency are important, like smartphones, smartwatches, and tablets. Let's break down what an SoC includes and why it's essential:

### Key Parts of an SoC
- CPU (Central Processing Unit)
- Memory
- I/O Ports (Input/Output)
- Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
- Digital Signal Processor (DSP)
- Power Management
- Special Features
- 
### Why SoCs Are Awesome

- **Space Saving**: By combining everything into one chip, SoCs help make devices smaller and more portable.
- **Energy Efficient**: Because all the parts are so close together, they use less power, which is especially important for battery-operated devices.
- **High Performance**: Since data doesn't have to travel far, SoCs can process information faster.
- **Cost Effective**: Building a single chip is often cheaper than using multiple parts, reducing the cost for manufacturers and, ultimately, for consumers.
- **Reliable**: Fewer parts mean fewer points of failure, making devices with SoCs generally more dependable.

### Some Popular SoCs You Might Know

- **Apple A-Series**: Powers iPhones and iPads.
- **Qualcomm Snapdragon**: Found in many Android phones.
- **Samsung Exynos**: Built for Samsung devices.
- **NVIDIA Tegra**: Powers devices like the Nintendo Switch.

## 2. Types of SoCs

- **Microcontroller-based SoC**: These SoCs are built around a microcontroller, designed for simple control tasks in everyday devices. Known for their low power usage and efficiency, they’re perfect for applications like home appliances, car systems, and IoT devices, where processing needs are minimal, and power savings are essential.
- **Microprocessor-based SoC**: This type features a microprocessor, which can handle more demanding tasks and run operating systems. Commonly used in smartphones and tablets, microprocessor-based SoCs manage multiple tasks and support complex applications, providing the higher processing power necessary for interactive and data-intensive applications.
- **Application-Specific SoC**: Custom-designed for specific, high-performance tasks, these SoCs excel in areas like graphics processing, network management, and multimedia applications. Optimized for speed and efficiency in their designated roles, they’re often used in graphics cards, AI hardware, and specialized industrial or financial systems that require precise, fast processing.

   



## 3. Introduction to VSDBabySoC


VSDBabySoC is a compact yet highly capable System on Chip (SoC) based on the RISC-V architecture. The primary objective of designing this small-scale SoC is to facilitate the simultaneous testing of three open-source intellectual property (IP) cores for the first time while also calibrating its analog components. The VSDBabySoC incorporates an RVMYTH microprocessor, an 8x phase-locked loop (PLL) for generating a stable clock signal, and a 10-bit digital-to-analog converter (DAC) that enables communication with various analog devices.


### BabySoC components

   - **RVMYTH (RISC-V CPU)**: RVMYTH is the brain of BabySoC, based on the open-source RISC-V design. It's a simple, customizable CPU that handles processing tasks and communicates with other parts of the SoC. This flexibility makes RVMYTH ideal for learning and experimenting with CPU architecture.

   - **Phase-Locked Loop (PLL)**: The PLL generates a stable clock signal to keep everything in BabySoC running in sync. It matches the SoC's clock with a reference frequency, ensuring reliable timing for RVMYTH and DAC. PLLs are widely used to keep signals aligned in communication and timing circuits.

   - **Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC)**: The DAC turns digital signals from RVMYTH into analog output, like sound or video. This allows BabySoC to connect with external devices that use analog signals, such as speakers
